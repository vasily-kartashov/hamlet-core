To Do:

* Support for PostgreSQL
* Support for Redis as Cache backup: http://qpleple.com/install-phpredis-on-amazon-beanstalk/
* Support for WebSockets
* Support for HTTP/2.0
* Easily describe entities reset for update situations, and writes to the cache. 
  Ideally POST to an entity should not hit database twice.
* Order test cases
