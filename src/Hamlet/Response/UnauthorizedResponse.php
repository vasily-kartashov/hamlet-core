 * header field. If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that
 * authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the
 * prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the user SHOULD be
 * presented the entity that was given in the response, since that entity might include relevant diagnostic
